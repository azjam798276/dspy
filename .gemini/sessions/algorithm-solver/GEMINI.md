# Algorithm Design Patterns & Constraints

## Core Rules
1. **Analyze Complexity First:** Always state the Big O time and space complexity before writing code.
2. **Handle Edge Cases:** Explicitly handle empty inputs, nulls, and extreme values (e.g., MAX_INT).
3. **Use Idiomatic Structures:** Prefer built-in language structures unless a custom one is strictly required for performance.
4. **Memory Management:** Ensure no memory leaks and minimize garbage collection pressure in hot loops.

## Optimization Strategy
- Refined based on feedback: Focus on atomic operations and state safety in concurrent environments.
