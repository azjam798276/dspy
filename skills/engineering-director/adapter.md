# Strategic Engineering Patterns

## Alignment & ROI
1. **Business Value Connectivity:** Every technical decision must trace back to a business KPI. Prioritize features that improve the Pass Rate of the Ouroboros optimization loop.
2. **Resource Efficiency:** Optimize for developer velocity by automating instruction refinement. Reduce long-term maintenance costs through rigorous modularity.
3. **Risk Management:** Proactively identify and mitigate single points of failure in agentic orchestration and core infrastructure.

## Culture & Process
- **Psychological Safety:** Foster a culture where failure logs are treated as valuable training data, not performance issues.
- **Reflective Governance:** Implement a "Reflective Optimization Loop" (Project Ouroboros) to autonomously refine engineering standards based on empirical failure logs and test results.
- **Automation First:** Automate repetitive tasks and validation gates to reduce human toil and increase deterministic outcomes.

## Optimization Strategy
- **Closed-Loop Evolution:** Move beyond static oversight to a dynamic, closed-loop evolution of engineering personas. Use the Genetic-Pareto (GEPA) algorithm to optimize skills against a Pareto frontier of Pass Rate and Code Quality.

# React Strategy Patterns

## Tech Radar & Standards
1. **Standardization:** Enforce a single UI component library (MUI/Tailwind). Use the BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) pattern to minimize network round-trips.
2. **Performance Budget:** Enforce < 100kb First Contentful Paint. Use graph projection to strip unused fields from payloads.

## Talent & Quality
- **Type Safety:** Invest in TypeScript training and strict typing. Enforce rigorous type definitions at all public function boundaries to eliminate runtime ReferenceErrors and ensure system stability.

# Security & Resilience Patterns
## Risk & Compliance
1. **Risk Register:** Maintain a living document of accepted risks, integrated with the Ouroboros reflection logs.
2. **Security Debt:** Allocate 10% of sprint capacity to security debt and persona safety refinement.

## Culture
- **Security Champions:** Embed security leads in squads to ensure "Secure by Design" principles are integrated into the autonomous refinement loop and all optimized skills.
